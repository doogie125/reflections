What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing creates the supporting files that identify the directory as a repository.
Git has no information without an initialization.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an interim identification of files from the working directory to be added to the next commit in the repository.
It offers the ability to choose specific files to be included in a commit.
