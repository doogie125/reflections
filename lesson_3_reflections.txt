When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you want to collaborate with others.
  When you want to share your project.
  When you want to create an online backup of your project.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Similar to how commits are manual, it is easier to keep changes grouped logically through manual pulls.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks and clones are similar, but forks are only on GitHub, simplifying the process.
  	They are used to copy an existing repository on GitHub that you might not otherwise be able to modify.
  Clones copy an entire repository.
  	General purpose copy of a repository.
  Branches are maintained within a single repository.
  	Modify files within a repository, without copying the whole repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  You can use diff and log to find changes, even if off line.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  Passing a file back and forth.
  Tracking and merging changes would be manual.
  It would be very simple conceptually.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
  Working in a branch other than the master allows experimentation and feature development without affecting the master code base until they are ready.
  Each branch can be dedicated to a specific idea, allowing them to be compartmentalized.
